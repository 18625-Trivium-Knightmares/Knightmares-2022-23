# Knightmares-2022-23
This is code from the 2022-23 FTC season, Power Play.

## Roadrunner
The [drive](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/tree/main/drive) folder has all of the roadrunner stuff. Look here for tuning from this season.

## TeleOp
The [TeleOp](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/tree/main/TeleOp) folder has all of the TeleOp we used

All of these files have the same controls exept for driving: preset heights, arm movement, linear actuator and claw

* [robotCentric.java](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/TeleOp/robotCentric.java) is teleOp with left joystick direction and right
joystick turn
* [tankDrive.java](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/TeleOp/tankDrive.java) is teleOp with tank control
* [teleOp](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/TeleOp/teleOp.java) is our most used teleOp code and is field centric

## Auto
The [auto](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/tree/main/auto) folder has everything for auto

* [AprilTagDetectionPipeline.java](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/auto/AprilTagDetectionPipeline.java) for april tag detection
* [left.java](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/auto/left.java) for the left side of the field and 
[right.java](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/blob/main/auto/right.java) for the right side of the field

## Samples/Practice
The [samplesPractice](https://github.com/cuber1515/Knightmares-2022-23/tree/main/samplesPractice) folder has a lot of random stuff, some of these files
are what we used to use and no longer do and some were only ever made for testing or figuring out code, either way this is just full of stuff that will
probably come in handy later if we get stuck trying to figure something else out
