# Why does this exist
Well throughout this year we have had many changes to our code. 

* In Autonomous we went from simply going forward for a few seconds to give us a 33% chance of scoring 20 points, to using EasyOpenCV and april tags to reliably park in the right place (100% 20 points), and by comp 3 we got Roadrunner working which let us add a pre-loaded cone on a tall junction so that we could get 25 points every auto. 
* In TeleOp we went from tank drive to field centrick controlls. 
* We have also had some tests that did not make it to comps but should still be here, such as splineRight. 

Basicly this a place for us to keep old files to look back to if needed
